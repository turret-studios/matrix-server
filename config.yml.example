##### Basic Information #####

# the port used to host the server on
serverPort: 8448

# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/delegate.md
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
server_name: "example.com"

##### TLS #####
# tls required a full chain certificate & private key

# boolean if TLS is enabled
#
#tlsEnabled: true

# PEM-encoded X509 certificate for TLS.
# This certificate, will need to be a valid and verifiable
# certificate, signed by a recognised Certificate Authority.
#
# If supplying your own, be sure to use a `.pem` file that includes the
# full certificate chain including any intermediate certificates (for
# instance, if using certbot, use `fullchain.pem` as your certificate,
# not `cert.pem`).
#
#tlsCertPath: /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem

# PEM-encoded private key for TLS
#
#tlsKeyPath: /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
